| Aug 22 |  10:20-10:50am   |                                                                                   I started by thinking about how to decode on paper by working through the problems by hand. I was able to build hypotheses for the first 3 problems. |
| Aug 22 |  7:25 - 7:35pm   |                            I started working on the first problem. I know that the code is written by writing the letter that is 17 characters ahead of the right character, but am still working through how to decode in using Java. |

| Aug 24 | 11:00 -  11:30am |  I solved and tested the first one (made sure the wraparound case worked, although it is not the most efficient code,  yet). Finished problem 2 and 3 and tested with RiddleTester by converting the values into ASCII values / chars. |
