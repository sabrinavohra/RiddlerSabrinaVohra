| Aug 22 | 10:20-10:50am |                                                        I started by thinking about how to decode on paper by working through the problems by hand. I was able to build hypotheses for the first 3 problems. |
| Aug 22 | 7:25 - 7:35pm | I started working on the first problem. I know that the code is written by writing the letter that is 17 characters ahead of the right character, but am still working through how to decode in using Java. |
| Aug 22 | 9:40 - 9:50pm |                                     Wanted to test out code for first problem, wrote pseudocode for 2,3, and 4. I have to figure out my problem with uploading to Git - I think I forgot to make it public. |
