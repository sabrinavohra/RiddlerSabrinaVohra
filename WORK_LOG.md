| Aug 22 |  10:20-10:50am   |                                                                                  I started by thinking about how to decode on paper by working through the problems by hand. I was able to build hypotheses for the first 3 problems. |
| Aug 22 |  7:25 - 7:35pm   |                           I started working on the first problem. I know that the code is written by writing the letter that is 17 characters ahead of the right character, but am still working through how to decode in using Java. |
| Aug 22 |  9:40 - 9:50pm   |                                                               Wanted to test out code for first problem, wrote pseudocode for 2,3, and 4. I have to figure out my problem with uploading to Git - I think I forgot to make it public. |
| Aug 23 | 11:25 - 11:30am  |                                                                                                                                                                            I started debugging the first one for the wraparound case. |
| Aug 24 | 11:00 -  11:30am | I solved and tested the first one (made sure the wraparound case worked, although it is not the most efficient code,  yet). Finished problem 2 and 3 and tested with RiddleTester by converting the values into ASCII values / chars. |
| Aug 27 |  8:30 - 8:45pm   |                                              I tested my code from the previous iterations and realized that it didn't work correctly, retried to make it more efficient and to make sure that it works correctly - only finished #1. |
| Aug 28 |  9:00 - 10:35pm  |                                                                                                  I finished #2. I worked for a long time on #3, I'm running into some bugs and I'm unable to properly decode using bitwise operators. |
